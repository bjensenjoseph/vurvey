- 4g latency 10x higher than home internet, 3g 50x
- Avoid http to https redirect, use HSTS (http strict transport security). hstspreload.org
- 14.6 KiB is one round trip
- QUIC - performance data transfer protocol
- Zopfli/Brotli - compression algorithm
- New header `Cache-control: immutable`, tells browser the file will never change
- `Cache-control: stale-while-revalidate=99`, tells browser to keep data for certain amount of time while new data is fetched in the background
